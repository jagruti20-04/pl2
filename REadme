the code creates a Tkinter GUI application for email slicing. Users can input their email, click a button to extract the username and domain, and reset the application to enter a new email. The extracted information is displayed in a Text widget. Labels and spacing elements are used for a cleaner layout.

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import the Tkinter library as `tk`.

2. **Create the Main Window:**
   - Create a Tkinter window (`window`).
   - Set window dimensions to 480x440 pixels.
   - Set the background color to "#BE361A" (a shade of red).
   - Make the window non-resizable.
   - Set the window title to 'Simple Email Slicer'.

3. **Define Functions:**
   - Create a function `result()` that extracts the username and domain from the entered email and displays the results. If an error occurs, it shows an "ERROR!" message.
   - Create a function `reset_all()` that clears the content of the Text widget and the Entry widget.

4. **Create Labels:**
   - Create a label `greeting` welcoming the user to the email slicer application.
   - Create a label `Info` providing instructions on how to use the application.
   - Create a label `entry_label` prompting the user to enter their email.
   - Create a label `result_label` indicating where the results will be displayed.
   - Create empty labels (`empty_label0` to `empty_label5`) for spacing.

5. **Create Entry Widget:**
   - Create an Entry widget (`entry`) for the user to input their email.
   - Use a StringVar (`e1`) to track the value of the Entry widget.

6. **Create Buttons:**
   - Create a button (`button`) labeled "Done!" that, when clicked, triggers the `result()` function.
   - Create a button (`reset`) labeled "Reset!" that, when clicked, triggers the `reset_all()` function.

7. **Create Text Widget:**
   - Create a Text widget (`text_box`) to display the results.
   - Set the height to 5 lines and the width to 50 characters.

8. **Pack Widgets into the Window:**
   - Pack the widgets in a specific order to arrange them in the window.
   - Use empty labels for spacing between widgets.

9. **Start the Main Loop:**
   - Call `window.mainloop()` to start the main event loop, allowing the GUI to respond to user interactions.
